# Odd Commands
Odd Commands is a PowerShell tool for storing and running commands you may not use frequently and are too long or awkward to memorize.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your PowerShell modules directory.

    The path to `Odd-Commands.psm1` should be `C:\Users\your username\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Odd-Commands\Odd-Commands.psm1`.

2. Run `Help oc` for usage information. The module will be automatically imported the first time you use it.
